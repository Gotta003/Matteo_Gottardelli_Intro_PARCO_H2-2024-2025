# Introduction

The purpose of this project is studying various ways to optimize a matrix transposition starting from a sequential code. All the analysis and reflection on the result obtained can be found in the report, but to get a more in-depth of all the simulations done to do this project and the definitive results obtained you can see the folder results. The ways that I explored the Transposition and Symmetry are done using MPI and then compare it with OMP, which will be results obtained from the first project:<br><br>
(1) **MPI Parallelism Per Row**: code running in MPI dividing the original matrix in rows assigned to each process involved<br>
(2) **MPI Parallelism Per Block**: code running in MPI dividing the original matrix in blocks of equal size on rows and columns and working with particular inputs<br>
**OMP**:<br><br>
The OMP algorithm chose for comparison is the best one obtained from Intro_Parco_H1, so the Block-Based Soltion.<br>
This is a project done by Matteo Gottardelli which is the owner and responsible of any element in this repository.<br><br>

# Software and Cluster Requirements
- **Cluster**:<br>
All the simulations you can find in the results folder have been done on a cluster offered by the University of Trento. These were all done in a node that had a minimum of 64 cpus for standard purposes and for OpenMP and for safe I reserved 128 Gb of memory, this is due to the fact that in this project was required the weak scaling, too, so in the worst cast the biggest matrix would have been 4096*4096*64 with an initial matrix being so big for each process, so 64 and considering all others allocation involved in this worst case, I've chosen a such big allocation.<br>
There are the following properties of the node on which I ran the simulations:<br>
```bash
Architecture:          x86_64

```
You can see these information on a Linux system using:
```bash
lscpu
```
The final simulations I've saved as definitive are one on 96 and two on 72. The first one is the more detailed one, so I'll leave you below the description for the on with 72 CPUs, but be careful that the data on the report are based on 96 CPUs architecture.

- **Native Machine**:<br>
This project was developed with a MacOS machine, the simulation wasn't done on the cluster, but I've said this to evidence that I didn't work with MobaxTerm (an application that gives a GUI interface to the user interfacing with a cluster). The download page for this application is right here an if you have a windows architecture it's highly recommended to use this: [mobaxterm](https://mobaxterm.mobatek.net/download.html)<br><br>
Some operations with Moba aren't necessary to use the instructions in this readMe, like transfering files from and to the cluster.<br><br>

# Installation and Configuration

## Global Protect
If you would like to connect to a cluster, the connection has to be protected by a VPN coonection, so to install and setup a secure connection to setup the cluster:<br>
1. Download Global Protect according to version of your architecture: [Global Protect](https://vpn-esterni.icts.unitn.it/global-protect/getsoftwarepage.esp)<br>
2. Open Global Protect App<br>
3. Connection to a vpn portal. If you are part of the Unitn University, you can set the Portal to:
```bash
   vpn-mfa.icts.unitn.it
```
4. Pressing connect you will be redirect to an external login page and putting the credentials the connection will be set
## Clone Git
1. Access to your GitHub account, running the command below in the terminal on your computer:
```bash
cd ~
gh auth login
```
If it doesn't work you may have to download some extra dependencies, like gh.
If you are on MacOS or Linux you can install homebrew. To verify if homebrew is already install run on terminal:
```bash
brew --version
```
If that doesn't put out Homebrew and the version, it does mean you haven't installed it, yet. So, to install it run:
```bash
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
```
Now, doing:
```bash
brew install <missing command>
```
brew will be updated and that command will be integrated in your terminal. So, install with this method gh<br><br>

2. After the command run successfully, you will have to do some choices. Select Github.com then HTTPS, type Y and press Login with a web browser and then press enter. You can use any other type of method, but I'm going to explain it how I have done it<br>
3. In the new open panel, insert the credentials and the one-time code generated on terminal and authorize the connection
4. Insert your passkey and after that you will see on your terminal as last line "Logged in as <Your ID on GitHub><br>
5. Now run this command to clone the above repository:
```bash
gh repo clone Gotta003/Matteo_Gottardelli_Intro_Parco_H2-2024-2025
```
6. To see, if you have successfully clone the repository try to access to it, running:
```bash
cd Matteo_Gottardelli_Intro_Parco_H2-2024-2025
```
Now, your are in the folder.<br><br>

## Cluster 
### Access Cluster
1. Now leaving the previous terminal window of the cloned repository, but it has to still be open, open a new terminal window
2. Run the command to access to the cluster (be careful that the VPN is active:
```bash
ssh <username>@hpc.unitn.it
```
If you have another cluster change the obvious parameters.
3. Insert the required password
4. In the University of Trento, I you are inside the cluster you will see your username@<one of two node in the cluster (n1 and n2)>
### Import Project
All the required codes that have to be run are in the "Matrix Transposition" folder, so we have to transfer that folder on the cluster. Now you should have two terminal windows, one in the cloned repository and another connected to the cluster. If so, follow these steps:
1. Run this command in the cloned repository terminal:
```bash
cd Matrix_Transposition
pwd
```
If not present or gives error, install with (if on MacOS or Linux):
```bash
brew install pwd
```
2. Make an alias, copy this instruction, but substitute with <Path From pwd> the path outputed previously
```bash
local_path='<Path From pwd>'
```
If that doesn't work, maybe the '' are indexed different, so change them manually
3. Create another alias with your email of the cluster you have logined with, if you are part of Unitn Cluster it is like:
```bash
cluster_mail='<username>@hpc.unitn.it'
```
4. Knowing that you would like to load all files in a specific directory, save in an alias the destination path of this folder, with you what it to be in the position you are on the cluster terminal, you can run this (ON CLUSTER):
```bash
pwd
```
5. Copy this path and create on the other terminal running this:
```bash
cluster_path='<Path Destination>'
```
6. Now, if you have correctly set the alias, you can directly run this command, in the native terminal (NOT THE CLUSTER ONE):
```bash
scp -r $local_path $cluster_mail:$cluster_path
```
After this you will required to insert the password to access to your cluster account and after that then running this you will see the files:
```bash
cd MPI_Matrix_Transposition
ls
```
If you have any problem with scp, try to install it with brew or verify the content of the three variables running:
```bash
echo $local_path
echo $cluster_mail
echo $cluster_path
```
<br>

### Import Libraries
To run the simulation as I've run it, you have to include some libraries in the cluster, in specific, but here you these possibility:<br>
1) You want to run the simulations via the pbs files and there the libraries are added, so you can skip right now<br>
2) Do the simulation in an interactive session, because you may want to see the behaviour of a particular simulation of a set of parameters, so do this each time you enter in a new one<br>
3) You can set them as default libraries, so they will be directly included in the interactive session<br><br>
The simulation have been done using gcc91 and mpich library. The first one is the C compiler Version 9.1.0, meanwhile mpich is to support MPI compilation and running and in particular is mpich-3.2.1--gcc-9.1.0.<br>
Remember that you are free to use other libraries, but if you want to emulate the simulations and you chose 3) follow this:<br>
1. We have to modify the .bashrc file, an hidden one. Go to the head node, if you are in Matrix_Transposition, you may do:
```bash
cd ..
ls -la
```
2. Now theoretically, you will be in the folder with .bashrc, run:
```bash
vi .bashrc
```
3. The file will be opened and you have to press I to be able to modify it. So, press I and insert with copy and paste under #User specific aliases and functions, this:
```bash
module load gcc91
alias gcc=gcc-9.1.0
module load mpich-3.2.1--gcc-9.1.0
```
4. Now to exit the file type the following in order:
• 'esc' button
• :w in order to save the file
• :q in order to close the file
5. Now try run a try interactive session in order to see if .bashrc works, so run:
```bash
qsub -I -q short_cpuQ
```
```bash
module list
```
You will see all the modules you have loaded, including gcc91 and numactl. After this you can exit from the interactive session running:
```bash
exit
```
<br>

## Run Project
### Warnings before Running
Be careful before running of two things:
1. Before runnnig a PBS file you have to change inside it the path to create the files on it, according to the path in your cluster to save it in the directory you like. You can done it directly on the Cluster going in the folder previously exported Matrix_Transposition and performing:
```bash
nano <name .pbs file>.pbs
``` 
This will open you an interactive environment on which you can modify the file.<br>
Both the pbs file have the line to modify at 61. And instead of that you have to modify the username and after it the path to the destination folder.<br>
After doing this to exit from this modality press (control + X), then Y and ENTER. Now you can freerly run your pbs file as is explain in advance.<br><br>
2. My C code in order to run on the cluster with simulation trigger implicitly the cache in order to free it an make it as clear as possible. To do this in the header file I've put the values of the caches extracted from the command lscpu on the node with 96 CPU. This will guarantee a pretty good clean with all the system with equal or less cache dimensions. But if you run in a smaller node requesting a lower number of CPUs or you are not running on my same cluster as introduced before, you may need to change these costant. To see the properties of the node you want to run on, you can perform:
```bash
lscpu
```
Then change if you want these constants, by doing the command nano on functions.h and modify them at lines according to your system. Obviously, if you have more caches or less you have to manually change the function ClearAllCaches. Mine properties are the following: (CACHEL1D 32KB, CACHEL1I 32KB, CACHEL2 1024KB, CACHEL3 36608KB (less than 36MB but this was to made to make it a perfect power of 2)).<br><br>

### Running Time
Now the environment is completly set and you can start running the project. You have two possibilities:<br>
1) PBS execution<br>
In the folder you will find two files .pbs, one transposition_complete.pbs (to run requires almost 15 minutes), which will perform all the simulations at I have performed to develop this project and a transposition_essential.pbs (to run requires 4 minutes), which are the essential like the best implicit algorithm and compilation with flags and the best OMP.<br>
To run it you perform this:
```bash
qsub <pbs file>
```
If you want to monitor the code, you may run:
```bash
qstat -u <username>
```
This pbs will generate a folder results, if already presence, will add an integer after it and generate various files .csv for the results and for the single times one general and one for each mode to see detailed specific for each modes jump to [Code Overview](#code-overview). 
At the end of execution the files will be moved in the first created folder, but not the transpose.o and transpose.e files which are the prints on stdout and stderr, that are created when the pbs file expires its execution. So you have to them with this command:
```bash
mv transpose.o <dest_folder>
mv transpose.e <dest_folder>
```
This isn't mandatory, but if you would like a detailed overview you have to do this, because with the next .pbs execution they will be overwritten.<br><br>
The definitive simulation was performed in a node with 96 CPUs, but to accomodate the conditions above, the system may give you a 72 CPUs node, so some performances may be different because of that.<br>
2) Interactive Session
To run a simulation of a desired combination of parameters, you have to follow these steps:
1. Open an interactive session, with the following parameters:
```bash
qsub -I -l select=1:ncpus=64:ompthreads=64:mem=128Gb -q short_cpuQ
```
2. Go to the folder and check the details of the architecture, if there is what you are expecting:
```bash
cd Matrix_Transposition
lscpu
```
3. Compile the code with gcc command the sequential code of the desired size or test_mode (to see the sintax of each parameter jump to [Code Overview](#code-overview))
```bash
mpicc -O0 functions.c transpose.c -o transpose -fopenmp -lm
```
The definitive simulation was performed in a node with 96 CPUs, but to accomodate the conditions above, the system may give you a 72 CPUs node, so some performances may be different because of that.<br><br>
4. Then run:
```bash
mpirun -np <num_procs> ./transpose SO0 1 <size> <test_mode> 25
```
This will generate 4 files, two dedicated for sequential code (time and average) and two general. This is the code sequential with no optimization. If you want to know the exact inputs go to the following section [Input Parameters](#input-parameters)<br><br>
5. Now you can perform which compilation you like, following this structure:
```bash
mpicc <efficiency flag -O0/-O1/-O2> functions.c transpose.c -o transpose -lm
```

### Download Results
If you want to transfer a file or a folder from cluster to your local machine, you have to perform the previous scp command in reverse. So, create a variable for the destination location:
```bash
dest_path=<dest_path>
```
And then run the following command (if a file remove -r, the example is a folder using the previous data):
```bash
scp -r cluster_mail:cluster_path dest_path
```
Being csv files, I've computed the results and the graphs on Excel, importing the general file, but you may use python natively in the cluster to elaborate the data. Arrived here, you have obtained your desired data on your local machine.<br><br>

# Code Overview
## Input Parameters
The code takes as for input 6 parameters and an extra for the flag -np:<br>
1 & 2. Acronym and modes - The first two parameters to give in input to the system is an acronym and an integer indicating a particolar mode. To allow an easy recognition and collection in Excel each different combination with an identifier that may be customable was added as the first parameter.<br>
Each mode is identified with an integer and if there are any particular configuration with flags can be indicated thanks to the acronym, this is not the case, and there are the configurations (acronym - mode) that I have used according to my code:<br>

            <th>Compiler Code</th>
            <th>Mode</th>

            <td>SO0</td>
              <td>1</td>
              <td>Sequential Code, with no optimization</td>

            <td>4</td>
              <td>Optimize Version of the Mode 3 algorithm that performs MPI Block Transposition</td>
        </tr>
</table>
You can add other signatures as you wish there is no limit, the most important thing is that in order to have speedup and efficiency in the results, you have to run it mandatory with the same code tag name, the same mode and insert in -np flag parameter 1. How you use the acronyms is your business, because I don't know with which flag you are running. Obviously, you have to pay attention to this, if you are in an interactive session, if you are using my pbs files, don't worry because they are already preimposted.<br><br>
3. Size - The algorithm works only with power of two and sizes between 16 and 4096, so it takes as input the exponential of the power from 4 to 12 (16->4, 32->5, 64->6, 128->7, 256->8, 512->9, 1024->10, 2048->11, 4096->12), for the weak scaling case, its handled properly inside the program.<br><br>
4. Test Mode - The project assigned asked only to analyze a standard case, so assign to a matrix random numbers, verify if that is symmetric and make a transposition, but to verify different behaviours I've created 4 test mode, the first for normal usage and the others for testing.<br>

        </tr>
</table>
The generation of the same values obviously doing simulations will logically be inaccurate if the cache is not free. In my code the problem is not present in the most cases, thanks to a function that indirectly frees the caches, so these static matrices would be a problem. In this project, I focused on the first mode in order to study reproducibility.<br><br>
5. Samples - In my code, at each execution will be output directly the average of the times, in order to internally compute the speedup and the efficienct thanks to that algorithm a number of samples can be inputed and all the outputs will be viewable in times*.csv files, but the average time, the speedup and the efficiency will be calculated according to the 40% in the middle of the data. Because of this I've decided to put a minimum of input samples per simulation on 25, in order to take the 10 values in the middle of an ordered array and cutting off the outliers, but there is no above limit, but to it parsimonously, otherwise your simulation can be take an enormous amount of time.<br><br>
6. Scaling - This is a parameter that accepts only 0 and 1, the first one is for strong scaling, so a fixed size and a changing number of processes computation, which is the standard reasoning, the second is for weak scaling, so for each process has to be allocated the same starting quantity, so the only way to do that is creating an initial matrix N*num_procsxN, assigning to each process an NxN. This is recommended to be runned with mode 2 and only with that, the logic with the other was not implemented, because was not asked for the delivery.<br><br>
EXTRA -np. Number of Processes - This is mandatory parameter and I have used a power of 2 and the numbers have to be between 1 and 64, so in this specific project could not be run threads other than 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32 and 64. The program should handle the cases that are not suitable with the mode, for example in mode 2 it executes with a correct number, because can be inserted an higher number of processes than rows, but will be threated as the number of rows, instead with mode 3 and 4 the program will directly exit.<br><br>

## Flow of the program
1. Verify that the input parameters inserted are correct (See above [Input Parameters](#input-parameters))<br>
2. Delete exceeding processes and initialize the number of rows or the block dimension per process<br>
3. Setup communicators with the custom types, counts and displacements
4. Starting simulations, at each iterations, which will be equal to the number of samples, will happen this:<br>
   - 3.1 The cache is freed with the reasoning told before, which is an implicit call of the cache<br>
   - 3.2 Allocation space of the start matrix and the destination one and the initialization according to the test mode inputed and the allocation varying according to the scaling variable according to perform a strong scaling (0) or weak scaling (1)<br>
   - 3.3 Allocate submatrices in which the main matrix is divided and broadcasting of the main from rank 0 to the others<br>
   - 3.4 Simulation with starting time, end time in which the purpose of this program acts. This is checking if the start matrix is symmetric and then if not true transpose it in the destination matrix according to the starting modality<br>
   - 3.5 The memory is freed and the time obtained is written on a file according to the specific mode and on the general one of the times and then is saved in a local array<br>
4. After the simulations are all done, the array in which the times are saved is reorder with a bubblesort algorithm<br>
5. Then, is took from that reordered array the 40% in the middle and from it is computed the average time and if was done the sequential code with the size and the test mode equal to this simulation, are computed the scaling and the efficiency, too. The obtained resultes are saved in simulation summary files for each mode and general ones, which are different from the one with each single times.<br>
6. Now, the program is ended an ready to get other data as input.<br><br>
